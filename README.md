# ü•∑ The Sacred Scrolls of Tanto - AKA - Tanto Community Policy Repo
### A Repository of Digital Wisdom

Welcome, fellow shadow warrior, to the grand collection of Tanto policy manifests. Here, digital ninjas from across the realms share their battle-tested configurations.

*"For as the cherry blossom drifts on the wind, so too must our policies flow through the network"* - Ancient NetNinja Proverb

## üìú The Ancient Texts
Before contributing your wisdom, study the sacred scrolls of Tanto:
[Tanto Policy Format Specification](https://github.com/NetNinjaCorp/Tanto/tree/main)

## üó∫Ô∏è Map of the Dojo
```
/Policies/
  /CompanyName/          # Your clan's territory
    /PolicyName/         # Your technique scroll
      /vX.Y.Z.json      # The sacred text
      /vX.Y.Z.msgpack   # Battle-ready format (auto-generated)
```

Example of a master's scroll:
